1, Pass by reference when using vector and other STL containers if needed! And notice that passing by value might be a waste of time.
2, For BFS/DFS, validation before adding node! 
3, When designing, ask yourself: does something should be hidden? It's a begin of a good design.
4, Notice that node->next may be changed in a loop. Do not use it as an end condition.
5, Problems need to review:
    Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
    Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
    Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node I/II
    Text Justification
    Valid Number
    Length of Last Word
    Insert Intervals
    Word Ladder I/II
    First Missing Positive
    Trapping Rain Water
    Longest Vaild Parentheses
    Reverse Nodes In K-Group
    Merge K Sorted Lists
    Container With Most Water
    Median of Two Sorted Arrays
